            <h2>What is Grady?</h2>
            <p>Grady is a gradually typed language.  It is the implementation of a language developed in a paper by Dr. Harley Eades and Michael Townsend called <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/ct-gradual-typing/Papers/blob/master/MFPS17/main.pdf">"The Combination of Dynamic and Static Typing from a Categorical Perspective"</a>.  For more on the language design follow the link to the paper.

            <h2>Website Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This website is a summary of how to use the two main Repls that Grady comes equiped with, the Surface and Core Repl.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "Getting Started" section is a step-by-step guide to downloading and installing Grady.  For ease of use, we have created Grady as a Stack package.  Stack does all of the heavy lifting so you will be up and running quickly!
            </p>
            <p>
                In the "How To Use Grady" section you will find a brief description of all Repl commands used in both 
                Repls as well as the types and syntax of the language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally in the the "Examples section we have several examples to help you get a feel for the language and see its features.
